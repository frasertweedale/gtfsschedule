GTFSBrisbane
============

Shows next departing trains from a given station id.

### Dependencies

* Python 3.4

### Motivation

I'd like to see next departing trains without pegging the translink API
every X seconds/minutes or so. This little script shows the departure
times, but keeping cached versions of the schedule.
