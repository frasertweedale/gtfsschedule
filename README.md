GTFS-Schedule
=============

Be on time for your next public transport service.

## Motivation

The command is intended to be invoked frequently in a status bar (such as
[xmobar](https://github.com/jaor/xmobar)) showing next departing services for
one particular stop.

The command shows remaining minutes in order to leave the current spot (e.g.
office) and to make the service with minimizing the amount to wait for the
service.


## Installation

### From source

Haskell provides a tool called
[stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) which can be installed
on many systems.

Using `stack` you can compile and install:

    stack install
    
in your local folder. Make sure it is in your `$PATH`

### Packages

Experimental packages are available for Fedora 24 via
[copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/romanofski/gtfsschedule/).

## Using

### Preparing the data

Run the setup command like:

    gtfsschedule setup
    
The database is created by default in: `$HOME/.local/share/gtfs/`

### Invoking the command

Find out which stop code it is you need to monitor from your service provider.

As an example this is Brisbane's Roma St, platform 8 stop code:
[600029](https://jp.translink.com.au/plan-your-journey/stops/600029).

Once you have your stop code, invoke the command to show next departing services:

    # Transport leaves in 11 minutes
    gtfsschedule monitor 600248 --walktime 0
    Desitnation 11 min (13:17:00)

The example invokes the command with an explicit `--walktime` option. The option
is used to indicate how long it takes to get to the stop. For example:

    # Transport leaves in 11 minutes, factor in a walk time to the stop/station of 7 minutes
    gtfsschedule monitor 600248 --walktime 7

    # Factor in realtime updates
    gtfsschedule monitor 600248 --walktime 7 -r

### Config examples for status monitors

Xmobar:

    Run Com "gtfsschedule" ["monitor", "600248", "-r", "--walktime", "7"] "gtfs" 600
